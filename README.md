This is an experiment with the MacOS VideoToolbox APIs.

VideoToolbox is supposed to be the replacement for the platform
codec interface Apple removed when they rewrote Quicktime.
Mostly I just want to develop my own understanding of the call
sequences, especially important given the current lack of documentation.
But it would be nice to develop some simple transcode tools.
